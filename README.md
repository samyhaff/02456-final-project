# 02456-final-project

This repository contains the notebooks used in this project to retreive docuements, fine--tune the models and evaluate their performance. A lot of inspiration and code has been taken from this [article](https://yjernite.github.io/lfqa.html) by Yacine Jernite. Much of this code also exists on the Huggingface [lfqa-reposetory](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/tree/main/longform-qa).

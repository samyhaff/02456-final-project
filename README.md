# 02456-final-project

This repository contains the notebooks used in this project to retreive docuements, fine--tune the models and evaluate their performance. 


A lot of inspiration and code has been taken from this [article](https://yjernite.github.io/lfqa.html) by Yacine Jernite. Much of this code also exists on the Huggingface [lfqa-reposetory](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/tree/main/longform-qa).  

The code has not been run locally but on HPC hosted by The Technical University of Denmark. Therefore, some modifications might be needed to run the code.
